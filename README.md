# Text Adventure Game: Legend of the Lost City
## Project Description
This project implements a simple Java-based text adventure game. Designed as a “mini project” for Junior Game Developers at 'SiTelu Studios', the game challenges the player, Rafly Zulfikar AlKautsar, to explore the long-lost legendary city of Ardhana. The player will face various challenges, make crucial choices that affect character attributes (health and experience points), and finally uncover the mystery behind the Gem of Light and the lost city.
This project aims to demonstrate the understanding and application of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, player input management, and gameplay logic in an interactive environment.
*(Please note: Some parts of the codebase, including variable names and comments, are written in Indonesian for clarity among local developers.)*
## Short Storyline: The Legend of the Lost City
The main character, Rafly Zulfikar AlKautsar, begins his adventure in a city, hearing about rumors of the lost City of Ardhana. His journey takes him through the Mystical Forest, Secret Caves, facing ancient traps, puzzles, and guardian creatures. Every choice Rafly Zulfikar AlKautsar makes will determine the continuation of the story, the risks faced, and the *reward* earned, until the ultimate goal of finding the Gem of Light and unraveling the mystery of the Lost City.
